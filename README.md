- 👋 Hi, I’m Siddharth and I've graduated from The University of Queensland with a Master's Degree in Data Science. 

- 👀 I like working on platforms such as AWS, Tableau using Python, SQL & R (even MATLAB). I also love coding in Java & C/C++ (they say old is gold)! 
I'm always curious about new and emerging technologies which drives me to stay up-to-date with industry expectations from options. 

- 🌱 Although I am primarily working with AWS SageMaker on Machine Learning Projects, I am also eager to learn the other parts of AWS and also plan to start Azure and GCP! 

- 💞️ I’m looking out for any opportunities that involve Machine Learning or Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Engineering, Data Analysis and Visualization. I love transforming data into a more visual representation to depict various insights that we can grab from it. Data is here to stay so why not try to understand it better? 

- 📫 You can always reach me on my email: kcxsid@gmail.com or via my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/s1ddharth/

Hope you have a good day!
